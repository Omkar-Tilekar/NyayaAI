# 🟢 TYPE YOURSELF: Practice aggregating APIRouters in FastAPI.
# Uncomment or type the code below.
#
# Why this file exists: To consolidate all v1 endpoint sub-routers 
# (research, drafting, admin) under a unified namespace.
#
# Common mistake: Forgetting to register routers here, which leads to 
# "404 Not Found" when calling endpoints in frontend.
#
# How it will evolve: More features (e.g. users, authentication, audits)
# will be registered as separate routers as the app grows.

# Health Check router registered directly here
# @api_router.get("/health", tags=["system"])
# async def health_check():
#     """
#     System health check endpoint. Returns status of DBs and backend service.
#     """
#     return {
#         "status": "healthy",
#         "services": {
#             "api": "online",
#             "mongodb": "pending_connection",
#             "qdrant": "pending_connection"
#         }
