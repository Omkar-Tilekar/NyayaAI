# 🟢 TYPE YOURSELF: Practice using FastAPI BackgroundTasks.
# Uncomment or type the code below.
#
# Why this file exists: To let administrators upload judgments and Acts
# which are asynchronously parsed, embedded, and index-synced in Qdrant.
#
# Common mistake: Running long CPU-bound tasks directly inside the request handler,
# which locks the event loop. Always use BackgroundTasks or a task queue.
#
# How it will evolve: Later we will connect this to a real Text Splitter,
# an embedding service, MongoDB models, and Qdrant clients.
